# cmd_line_cd_helper
This .bat file allows you to quickly switch between pathes in the command line.

This code has been created during this [video](link).

To use it you have to add the directory of the cds.bat in the PATH variable of your system.  
Then you have to define keywords with their corresponding pathes in the .bat file.  
To use it in the command line, type: cds yourkeyword  
This will take you immediately to the path that has been defined for this keyword.

Cheers
